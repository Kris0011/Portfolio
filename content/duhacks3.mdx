## A Glimpse into the Organizing Journey of DUHacks 3.0

Ever wondered what it's like to be behind the scenes of a hackathon? Is it just about coding marathons and late-night coffee runs? I am sharing my experience of organizing DUHacks 3.0 and unravel the magic behind the scenes.

## Setting the Stage: Pre-Hackathon Excitement

Our journey began during Diwali, the festival of lights. Fueled by an overwhelming excitement, our web team couldn't wait to get started. The excitement was so high that we began our work earlier than planned, diving into the project with enthusiasm. Within just a week, our website was ready!

Spending nights with Rajat Nai, our Web Lead, and Kunj Patel, the Lead Organizer, was nothing short of amazing. These moments weren't just about coding; they were about bonding, sharing ideas, and building friendships that would last a lifetime.

## Building Partnerships: The Sponsorship Challenge

Organizing a hackathon involves more than just coding and planning. One of the biggest challenges we faced was securing sponsorships to fund the event. With no other funds available, our dedicated sponsorship team reached out to potential sponsors, showcasing the value and impact of DUHacks 3.0. Their hard work and perseverance paid off, and thanks to the team and sponsors, we were able to provide two days of food, supplies, and other essentials for our participants, making the hackathon experience comfortable and enjoyable for everyone.

## Day 1: February 24 - Hackathon Kickoff

The first day of DUHacks 3.0 was full of excitement and energy. The morning began with informative sessions, setting the stage for the hackathon's challenges and opportunities. An inspiring opening ceremony followed, filling the room with anticipation and motivation.

In the afternoon, a delicious lunch was served, fueling everyone for the exciting challenges ahead. Participants from around the world joined forces to collaborate and innovate, giving their best with full potential to create innovative projects.

As evening approached, snacks were served, providing a much-needed energy boost for the final stretch of the day. To add a touch of fun and relaxation, games were organized, allowing participants to unwind, bond, and recharge.
