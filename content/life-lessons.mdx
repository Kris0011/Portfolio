## Some Books You Read and Forget

Some books stay with you forever — not because you remember every page, but because they change how you think and live.

Here's what I've learned from a few books that really stayed with me.

## 1. Small steps make big changes — Atomic Habits

I used to think big changes needed big actions. Like waking up one day and changing my life completely.

But this book taught me — it's the tiny things you do every day that shape you. Reading for 5 minutes, drinking more water, writing a little, walking a bit — they all add up over time. You don't notice it every day, but one day you'll look back and see how far you've come.

## 2. You can't care about everything — The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck

There's too much happening around us — news, social media, other people's opinions, random drama.

If you try to care about all of it, you'll just be tired and stressed.

This book taught me to save my energy for the people and things that actually matter to me — and let the rest go.

## 3. Not everyone has to like your choices — The Courage to Be Disliked

We all want people to think we're making the "right" decisions. But if you keep trying to please everyone, you end up losing yourself.

This book reminded me that it's okay if people don't agree with me. My life is mine to live — and I don't need approval to follow my path.

## 4. The journey matters more than the goal — The Alchemist

We all have dreams. But life doesn't always go exactly as planned.

This book taught me that even detours, failures, and random moments are part of the story. Sometimes, the journey changes you more than reaching the goal itself.

## 5. Don't believe every thought you have — Don't Believe Everything You Think

Our mind can make problems that don't even exist.

Sometimes I'd think "I'm not ready" or "This will fail" — and I'd believe it. Now I stop and ask myself, Is this really true? Or is it just fear talking?

When you question your thoughts, you stop them from controlling you.

## 6. Money is about freedom — The Psychology of Money

I used to think money was just for buying things or earning as much as possible.

Now I see it's more about peace of mind. Money gives you the freedom to make choices — to take a break, try something new, or just live without constant stress.

## 7. Creativity is about mixing ideas — Steal Like an Artist

Nothing is 100% original. Every idea comes from something else — from people, experiences, or things you've seen.

The trick is to take those ideas, mix them, and add your own style. That's how creativity works.
